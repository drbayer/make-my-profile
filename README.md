# Make-My-Profile

As a user of \*nix-like operating systems, I have many custom settings to keep sync across my work computers, personal computers, or when I create a new user profile on server or workstation.  This is my attempt to keep all of these settings in sync across all desired systems.

The current iteration is geared toward Mac OS X only.  Future versions may work across other \*nix-like operating systems including Linux and BSD.

As always, use at your own risk.  YMMV
